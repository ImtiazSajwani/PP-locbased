Privacy preserving is the crucial method to safeguard the individual privacy. UJIIndoorLoc, which can be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ujiindoorloc, is the most comprehensive indoor positioning database (DB) or dataset. This DB includes 3 buildings that have 4 Floors. The classification is performed in 3 phases, namely building, floor and region. 

Indoor positioning system have applications such as robotsâ€™ localization for warehouses, source localization is used to estimate the localization of the subject indoor area like hospitals, libraries, shopping mall and airports. This localization can often be used to track people or monitor their activity, as it is often used by law enforcement agencies across the globe. This is where privacy preserving algorithm can play a critical role in cyberspace.
